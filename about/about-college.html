      <h2>About Our College</h2>
      <p>Established in <strong>2000</strong>, New English School & Junior College, Murgud is a proud branch of the renowned <strong>Jay Shivray Education Society.</strong> Rooted in the visionary mission of <strong>Late Hon. Sadashivrao Mandlik (M.P.)</strong>, the college was founded to provide quality English-medium education to students from rural and hilly regions. <br>It serves as a vital educational hub for students from Murgud and surrounding villages, offering a nurturing environment focused on academic excellence, discipline, and all-round development. As part of an institution that runs over 20 educational centers, New English School & Junior College continues to uphold the motto: "Kuni na raho durbal adnya, yachsathi ha shikshan yadnya", by ensuring that no child is deprived of quality education due to their location or background.</p>
      <h2>About Jay Shivray Education Society (JSES)</h2>
      <p>
  <strong>Jay Shivray Education Society (JSES), Murgud</strong>, was founded in <strong>1960</strong> by the visionary leader <strong>Late Hon. Sadashivrao Mandlik (M.P.)</strong>, with the noble motto:<br>
  <strong>"Kuni na raho durbal adnya, yachsathi ha shikshan yadnya"</strong><br>
  ("Let no one remain weak due to ignorance; this is our educational mission.")<br><br>

  At a time when educational facilities in the region were extremely limited, especially for girls and children of farmers, <strong>Mandlik Saheb</strong> established <strong>Shivraj Vidyalaya, Murgud</strong> to bring secondary education within reach of students from hilly, rural, and backward areas. Both he and his wife, <strong>Late Sou. Vijaya Mandlik</strong>, began their service as teachers in this very school.<br><br>

  Over the years, the society grew to meet the educational needs of the region. In <strong>1990</strong>, recognizing the challenges rural girls faced in accessing higher education, he founded <strong>The New College of Arts and Commerce</strong>, later renamed in <strong>1995</strong> as <strong>Sadashivrao Mandlik Mahavidyalaya, Murgud</strong>.<br><br>

  Today, <strong>JSES</strong> serves as an educational hub for <strong>25–40 villages</strong>, managing:<br><br>

  <strong>2</strong> Pre-primary schools<br>
  <strong>11</strong> High schools<br>
  <strong>5</strong> Higher secondary schools<br>
  <strong>2</strong> Ashram schools<br>
  <strong>2</strong> English medium schools<br>
  <strong>1</strong> Girls’ high school<br>
  <strong>1</strong> Industrial Training Institute (ITI)<br>
  <strong>2</strong> Hostels<br>
  <strong>1</strong> Senior College<br><br>

  Currently, around <strong>7,212 students</strong> are enrolled across various institutions under JSES, supported by a dedicated team of <strong>406 staff members</strong>. The society continues to expand and innovate in education, honoring the legacy and vision of <strong>Late Hon. Sadashivraoji Mandlik</strong>.
